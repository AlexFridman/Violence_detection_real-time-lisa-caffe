# Violence_detection_real-time_lisa-caffe
This is a project to detect the violence activities real-time with lisa_caffe_model
lisa_caffe_model is made by lisa anne(source:https://github.com/LisaAnne/lisa-caffe-public.git)
You should download lisa_caffe_model(cnn + LSTM) firstly,then train it.
The source data is UCF 101.
I run this in a NVIDIA 1080ti, the latency is 3s.
I am still improving it . 
If you have trained everything, just to run main.py to do real-time detection
The manual will tell the details
